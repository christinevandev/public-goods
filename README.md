## Sourcing public goods datasets for researchers

One of Govrn's goals is to promote the sourcing and analysis of open source public goods datasets for both academic and citizen science research efforts. 

Public goods datasets are often scarce, incomplete, or accessible only through the institutions or platforms that own the data (e.g. through APIs).
